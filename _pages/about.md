I have been at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in a collaborative effort to improve disability programs in the USA.
[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits) has
an excellent primer on the disability crisis. Additionally, I was a fellow in [Carson Chow's][carsonchow] lab at the [Laboratory of Biological Modeling](https://lbm.niddk.nih.gov) where I worked on some modeling projects and also some machine intelligence techniques.


From 2012-2015, I was an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI).](http://mbi.osu.edu)
My postdoctoral
mentors at MBI were [Robert M. Miura (NJIT)](http://m.njit.edu/~miura) and [KC Brennan (UofU)](http://neuroscience.med.utah.edu/Faculty/Brennan.html). I previously completed my Ph.D. in Biomathematics
at UCLA, where my advisor was [Tom Chou](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/tchou/).

In my research I meld contemporary data-driven techniques with more-rigorous mechanistically-minded first principles modeling. I also am interested in partially parametric methods where mechanistic models are coupled with unknown functions. Recently, I have been working on using neural networks for representing Bayesian posterior distributions, and the regularization of such networks using the principles from Bayesian modeling.
